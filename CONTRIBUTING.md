We love pull requests. Here is a quick guide:

1. You need to have `ant` and a JDK (at least version 1.5) installed.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Ensure that you have a clean state by running `ant test`.
4. Add your change together with a test. (Tests are not needed for refactorings and documentation changes.)
5. Format your code: Import the JUnit project in Eclipse and use its formatter or apply the rules in the `CODING_STYLE` file manually.
6. Run `ant test` again and ensure all tests are passing.
7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Now you are waiting on us. We review your pull request and at least leave some comments.
